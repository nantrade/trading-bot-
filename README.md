# running the application
This script is meant to be already running prior to buying the coin(s),
it needs to be running to pull information from binance and bittrex (price and trade requirements)
It takes only a few seconds to gather up all the information and be ready to enter in a coin symbol, but i would recommend running at least 30 seconds prior.

running it as simple as ```node pumpbot.js``` and waiting for the "Input coin:" prompt
